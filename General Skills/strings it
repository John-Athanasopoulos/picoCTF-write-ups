strings it - write up

We download the file "strings" and we are told to find the flag without running it.
So, we open the terminal, change to the directory in which our file is saved and type
"strings strings" (strings <filename.extension> in our case the file is strings without
an extension)

After that, and to skip any unnecessary work, we can press Ctrl + Shift + F and search
for "picoCTF". This way, we can find the flag: picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_c7fff9e5}
