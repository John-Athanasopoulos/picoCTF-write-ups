Bases - write up

We are first given the text: bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 and we are told that it has something to do with bases.
I open CyberChef and type the text into the input field. The encryption technique is immediately
recognised. The text is encrypted using the Base64 Technique. So I use decryption From Base64 and I get the
folloing flag:

picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
