First Grep: Part II - write up

We open the picoCTF shell, login with our picoCTF credentials and we are ready to search the flag.
We will need to search for the current problem, so we will need to cd in the needed directory.
So we need to do the following:

>cd ..
>cd ..
>cd /problems/first-grep--part-ii_4_ca16fbcd16c92f0cb1e376a6c188d58f/files

Now we are in the correct directory, so we have to search every file for our flag. In order to do this,
we can execute:

>grep 'picoCTF' -r

This way, we find the flag:
picoCTF{grep_r_to_find_this_0e28f3ee}
