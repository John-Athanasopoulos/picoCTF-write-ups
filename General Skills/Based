Based - write up

In order to complete this challenge you have to be kinda fast, so there isn't a lot of time
to spare. You will need to decrypt 3 different types of encryptions, so stick with CyberChef,
as it is an all-in-1 decrypting tool and will make this challenge for kids in preschool.

Run the command given in the terminal: nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 44303 and you will see the
following message:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Let us see how data is stored
oven
Please give the 01101111 01110110 01100101 01101110 as a word.
...
you have 45 seconds.....

Input:
________________________________________________________________________________________________

We open CyberChef and insert 01101111 01110110 01100101 01101110 to the input section. Afterwards,
we click the wand that appears next to the output section. We get the answer (in this case "oven")
and enter it into the terminal.
We are then given the next question that is:

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Please give me the 164 145 163 164 as a word.
Input:
________________________________________________________________________________________________

We open CyberChef again and insert 164 145 163 164 to the input section. We double click the 
previous recipe and continue as before, clicking the wand to get the word (in this case "test").
Lastly, we are see the following message:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Please give me the 7375626d6172696e65 as a word.
Input:
________________________________________________________________________________________________

We follow the exact same steps as before and find the encrypted word (in this case "submarine").

We have now completed the challenge and we recieve the following message:
