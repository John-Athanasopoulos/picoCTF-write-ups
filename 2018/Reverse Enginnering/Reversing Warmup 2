Reversing Warmup 2 - write up

We need to decode dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz from Base64 encryption to ASCII text.
As you can probably guess if you have seen other write ups from me, open CyberChef and enter
dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz in the input field. Recipe: From Base64. So we find the flag:
picoCTF{th4t_w4s_s1mpL3}
