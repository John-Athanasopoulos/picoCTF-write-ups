Forensics Warmup 2 - write up

If we download the image we will realise that indeed we can't open it. If we type in our terminal:
> strings flag.png
and scroll to the top, we will see that this picture is in JFIF format. So if we rename it to flag.jfif,
and afterwards open it we will find the flag: picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}
