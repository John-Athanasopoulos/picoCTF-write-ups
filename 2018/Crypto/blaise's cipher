blaise's cipher - write up

We are given a cipher code that if we are a little observant we can find a way to solve it even without
any historical knowledge. Having some experience on the subject, we easily understand this is a Blaise
de Vigenère cipher (as the title suggests). However even if we don't know that, the years of the text
(1467,1586,etc.) and especially 1914 and 1940 (second paragraph from the end) will guide us to what we
search. Thus, if we search 1914 1940 Blaise cryptography we will find "Vigenère cipher" in Wikipedia.
That's how you should think in Cryptography. Search every clue. But enough with the talking.. let's start.

The Vigenère cipher needs a key in order to be decrypted, and we don't have one. However there are
tools that can decrypt Vigenère ciphers without keys in the web (like: https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver")

If we paste the ciphertext and select for Language:English and hit Break Cipher, we will receive the
following message as result (plaintext):

The first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by Leon Battista Alberti
around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets. Alberti's system only switched
alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding
alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, in 1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula
recta, a critical component of the Vigenere cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, only provided a progressive,
rigid, and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.

What is now known as the Vigenere cipher was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553
book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso. He built upon the tabula recta of Trithemius, but added
a repeating "countersign" (a key) to switch cipher alphabets every letter. Whereas Alberti and Trithemius
used a fixed pattern of substitutions, Bellaso's scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily
changed simply by selecting a new key. Keys were typically single words or short phrases, known to both
parties in advance, or transmitted "out of band" along with the message. Bellaso's method thus required
strong security for only the key. As it is relatively easy to secure a short key phrase, say by a previous
private conversation, Bellaso's system was considerably more secure.

Blaise de Vigenere published his description of a similar but stronger autokey cipher before the court of
Henry III of France, in 1586. Later, in the 19th century, the invention of Bellaso's cipher was misattributed
to Vigenere. David Kahn in his book The Codebreakers lamented the misattribution by saying that history had 
"ignored this important contribution and instead named a regressive and elementary cipher for him [Vigenere]
though he had nothing to do with it". picoCTF{v1gn3r3_c1ph3rs_ar3n7_bad_095baccc}

The Vigenere cipher gained a reputation for being exceptionally strong. Noted author and mathematician Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) called the Vigenere cipher unbreakable in his 1868 piece "The Alphabet Cipher"
in a children's magazine. In 1917, Scientific American described the Vigenere cipher as "impossible of translation".
This reputation was not deserved. Charles Babbage is known to have broken a variant of the cipher as early as
1854; however, he didn't publish his work. Kasiski entirely broke the cipher and published the technique in the
19th century. Even before this, though, some skilled cryptanalysts could occasionally break the cipher in the
16th century.

Cryptographic slide rule used as a calculation aid by the Swiss Army between 1914 and 1940.
The Vigenere cipher is simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher disks. The
Confederate States of America, for example, used a brass cipher disk to implement the Vigenere cipher during the
American Civil War. The Confederacy's messages were far from secret and the Union regularly cracked their messages.
Throughout the war, the Confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases, "Manchester Bluff",
"Complete Victory" and, as the war came to a close, "Come Retribution".

Gilbert Vernam tried to repair the broken cipher (creating the Vernam–Vigenere cipher in 1918), but, no matter
what he did, the cipher was still vulnerable to cryptanalysis. Vernam's work, however, eventually led to the
one-time pad, a theoretically unbreakable cipher.
