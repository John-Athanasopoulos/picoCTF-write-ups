Inspect Me - write up

If we open the website and afterwards the inspector and head to body/div/div (the last one)
we will find the following comment:  I learned HTML! Here's part 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe

After that, if we go to the Style Editor tab and head to the bottom of the mycss.css, we will find the
second part of the flag: /* I learned CSS! Here's part 2/3 of the flag: ct0r_g4dget_e96dd105} */

We can see that the flag is completed: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_e96dd105}
However, at the Debugger tab in (index) we will find at the end a comment saying:
/* I learned JavaScript! Here's part 3/3 of the flag:  */, giving us nothing.

So the flag is: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_e96dd105}
