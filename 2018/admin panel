admin panel - write up

We download the .pcap file and open it with Wireshark. I decided to check first the TCP stream and I was
lucky doing it.
I started applying filters "tcp.stream eq 1" , then 2, then 3 etc. but I only could find the credentials
of Jimmy (username:jimmy,password:p4ssw0rd).
However, at "tcp.stream eq 5", right-clicking on the line 74 and then Follow/TCP Stream I see the following message:

user=admin&password=picoCTF{n0ts3cur3_9feedfbc}

So I understand that the flag is: picoCTF{n0ts3cur3_9feedfbc}
