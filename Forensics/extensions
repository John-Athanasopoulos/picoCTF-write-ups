extensions - write up

I downloaded the .txt file and stringed it, in case I was able to find the flag, but no luck.
I opened the text file and saw that in the beginning there was a string saying "PNG", so my guess was that it
was actually an image.
I opened the file in CyberChef (a really useful tool for cryptography and other uses) found here: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

When the file loaded, I saw that it was indeed a PNG image, so I pressed the little wand icon next to output that gave me
the actual flag which was: picoCTF{now_you_know_about_extensions}
