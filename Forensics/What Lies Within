What Lies Within - write up

I downloaded and opened the image and stringed it, without any important result.
Then, based on the challenge's name, I tried to binwalk it in order to find hidden files in the image. I didn't find the flag though.
Finally, based on the given hint, that there is data encoded somewhere and that there is an online decoder, I tried zsteg, in order to find hidden data in the image.
The output was:
b1,r,lsb,xy         .. text: "^5>R5YZrG"
b1,a,lsb,xy         .. ["\xFF" repeated 256 times]
b1,rgb,lsb,xy       .. text: "picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}"
b1,abgr,msb,xy      .. file: PGP Secret Sub-key -

So I finally managed to get the string which was: picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}
