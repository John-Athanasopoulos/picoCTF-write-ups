caesar - write up

We have to use the caesar cipher decryption, where (roughly) all characters are changed by a n factor.
For example if n = 1, A --> B, B --> C, etc.
So we take the inside of our flag, in our case "rgdhhxcviwtgjqxrdcdydkefyh", and we use it as input in an
online decrypting tool for this type of encryption (like https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher).
We play around with the factor n, and we see that when n = 15 or n = -11, our string becomes:
"crossingtherubiconojovpqjs"

So, we understand that our flag is: picoCTF{crossingtherubiconojovpqjs}
