First Grep - write up

We download the file and from the title of the challenge we understand we will
need to use grep in order to find the flag.
So we open the terminal, change to the directory that contains the file and then
type "grep 'picoCTF' file". This searches for all the strings containing the
sub-string picoCTF, and as our flag is in picoCTF{...} format, it is also going
to be displayed among the other words that contain picoCTF.
It turns out that the only word containing picoCTF is our flag:

picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_887251c6}
