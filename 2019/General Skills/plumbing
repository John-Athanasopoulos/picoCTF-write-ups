plumbing - write up

We begin and type "nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 21957" into our terminal.
We get a big series of strings, containing our flag.
While we could search for 'picoCTF' with Ctrl+Shift+F, the best way to find
the flag (and the reason this challenge exists) is to use a pipe! Thus, we can
get the flag in only one line of terminal commands.

To do this, we enter "nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 21957 | grep 'picoCTF'".
What this does is open the file and then search and find all the strings containing
'picoCTF' and thus our flag: picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_c1082838}
