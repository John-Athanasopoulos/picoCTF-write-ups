From picoCTF we are given the following:
flag: UFJKXQZQUNB
key: SOLVECRYPTO

The description helps us understand that this chalennge is solved with one-time pad. The easiest way
to do this, is to go to an online one time pad decryption tool such as:
https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/one-time-pad

We select Decrypt and put the flag into the plaintext field and the key to the encryption key field.
The result is: CRYPTOISFUN

So, the flag is: picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}
