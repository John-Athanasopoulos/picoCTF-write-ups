Flags - write up

A medium challenge in difficulty, but nevertheless a very original and beautiful one..

We download and open the image given to us. We quickly understand that the first flags are the ones
standing for PICOCTF, so we keep them in mind.
At the moment the flag is: PICOCTF{F--------T-FF}
Based on the fact that the whole challenge is about flags, I believe that the first word is "flag"
and as the 3rd flag is the same with the 6th one, the flag is: PICOCTF{FLAG-A---T-FF}

We also see that the 5th letter is the same as the 9th one. I guessed it must have been "S", as it a
common letter and the whole challenge is about flags. So the flag is: PICOCTF{FLAGSA--ST-FF}

My best guesses at the moment were "FLAGSARESTUFF" and "FLAGSARESTIFF", but none of them was the answer.
For some time I couldn't find anything new, so I decided to google "flags letters" and BOOM.

These flags are actually International maritime signal flags. I used to know their existence as a kid
but had forgotten about them completely, so no surprise they reminded me of something..
(You can see about them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags . Don't
try to decrypt the message with some random picture because most of them were wrong, if I'm not mistaken).

I went to the board that had all the flags and the corresponding letters or numbers and found the flag,
which was: PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
