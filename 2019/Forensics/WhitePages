WhitePages - write up

We doenload the .txt file given to us and open it, to see that there is some invisible text. However, the
file isn't blank, so there has to be a way we can find what's written...

I tried to binwalk it to see if the text was just to mislead and check for any hidden files within the .txt file.
Didn't find anything important, so I decided to string it, although I knew I wouldn't be able to find anything.
Indeed, I didn't find anything really important.

What crossed my mind was that the text was made of different types of spaces. So I executed "xxd -g 1 whitepages.txt"
to convert the text to hex values. The text was a series of numbers and searching a bit on the internet, I found out
that there were two different space types contained in the text, holding the following values in the hex system:
- \x20
- \xe2\x80\x83

We can also see that these two types of hex values are repeated continuously throught the text, and this may suggest that
this is a binary file.
So I created a simple script to test this, which is the following:

//CodeStart
from pwn import *

with open("whitepages.txt", "rb") as file:
	d = bytearray(file.read())
	d = d.replace(b'\xe2\x80\x83', b'1')
	d = d.replace(b'\x20', b'0')
	d = d.decode("ascii")
	print(unbits(d))

//CodeEnd

What this does? It opens whitepages.txt, replaces one type of space with "0" and the other with "1" and then decodes it to
ASCII. Afterwards, it prints the message in readable form.
If we run this script, the result will be the following:

b'\xf5\xf6\xf6\x8f\x96\x9c\x90\xbc\xab\xb9\xf5\xf5\xf6\xf6\xac\xba\xba\xdf\xaf\xaa\xbd\xb3\xb6\xbc\xdf\xad\xba\xbc\xb0\xad
\xbb\xac\xdf\xd9\xdf\xbd\xbe\xbc\xb4\xb8\xad\xb0\xaa\xb1\xbb\xdf\xad\xba\xaf\xb0\xad\xab\xf5\xf6\xf6\xca\xcf\xcf\xcf\xdf\xb9
\x90\x8d\x9d\x9a\x8c\xdf\xbe\x89\x9a\xd3\xdf\xaf\x96\x8b\x8b\x8c\x9d\x8a\x8d\x98\x97\xd3\xdf\xaf\xbe\xdf\xce\xca\xcd\xce\xcc
\xf5\xf6\xf6\x8f\x96\x9c\x90\xbc\xab\xb9\x84\x91\x90\x8b\xa0\x9e\x93\x93\xa0\x8c\x8f\x9e\x9c\x9a\x8c\xa0\x9e\x8d\x9a\xa0\x9c
\x8d\x9a\x9e\x8b\x9a\x9b\xa0\x9a\x8e\x8a\x9e\x93\xa0\xcc\x9d\x99\xcb\xcf\x9d\xc7\xc9\xc6\x9a\x9a\xc6\xc7\xcb\xc7\xc9\xc9\x9a
\xc9\xc8\x99\xcc\xcf\xca\xc8\x99\xcf\xcf\xc9\x9e\xc6\xcd\x82\xf5\xf6\xf6'.

In order to fix this, we need to revert the values we've put to the script, thus replacing b'\xe2\x80\x83' with b'0'
and b'\x20' with b'1'. After we do this, the result is:

b'\n\t\tpicoCTF\n\n\t\tSEE PUBLIC RECORDS & BACKGROUND REPORT\n\t\t5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n\t\t
picoCTF{not_all_spaces_are_created_equal_3bf40b869ee984866e67f3057f006a92}\n\t\t'

This way, we find the flag which is: picoCTF{not_all_spaces_are_created_equal_3bf40b869ee984866e67f3057f006a92}
