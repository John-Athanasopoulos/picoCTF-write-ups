like1000 - write up

I download and open the 1000.tar file and it extracts into 999.tar and a filler.txt
So as the title suggests, I will probably have to do this 1000 times to finally get the flag.
The quickest way to do this is to write a custom script.

First cd into the directory that contains the .tar file and execute the following python3 script:

//StartCode

import tarfile

for i in range(1000):
	v = str(1000 - i)
	tf = tarfile.open(v+".tar")
	tf.extractall()
	os.remove(v+".tar")

//EndCode
The first time (for i=0), v = 1000 so tf opens the 1000.tar file, extracts its components and then
deletes it (in order not to be spammed with 1000 spare files).
In the end, all the tar files will be deleted and we will be left with a filler.txt (which is completely
useless), and an image flag.png
We open the image and we find the flag:

picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}

Summary: A lot of CTFs need custom scripts like this one. Programming is an essential skill!
